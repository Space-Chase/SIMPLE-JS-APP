Pokedex App
The Pokedex app is a simple web application that displays information about various Pokemon. The app allows users to view a list of Pokemon, along with their names and images. When a Pokemon is selected from the list, a modal dialog appears with more detailed information about that Pokemon, including its stats, abilities, and moves.

The app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the Bootstrap framework for responsive design. It fetches data from the PokeAPI using JavaScript's Fetch API and displays it dynamically using DOM manipulation.

The Pokedex app is a fun and interactive way for Pokemon fans to explore information about their favorite creatures. It can be used as a learning tool for those who are new to the Pokemon franchise or as a reference for more experienced players.
